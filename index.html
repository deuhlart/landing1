		    <p>The concept is really simple we propose you to taste quality beers in a simply magnificent place, where you will be able to see all type of animals but especially bears. But it's not only for adults, you can also bring your children to enjoy the place.

		    <p>If you come to our beautiful natural park you will have the chance to see different animals in an exceptional environment, but with a little luck you will be able to distinguish our 3 mascots. Who are without pretense the most splendid bears in the world (as long as nobody disputes this title).
